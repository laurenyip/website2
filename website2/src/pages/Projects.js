              This was my first hackathon project! With my amazing team, I
              helped design and implement a functional webapp that can take
              location data and output a list of the nearest hospitals and their
              emergency room wait time. [Jan 2024][nwHACKS 2024]

              One of my first REACT projects! A project website I made as the
              undergraduate research assistant for Rosie Lab. My project is
              called <strong>"Aware Like an Animal."</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              We researched interactions between people and virtual agents,
              towards the overall goal of making believable, interaction-aware
              virtual characters.

            <p>
              I analyzed and annotated participants' videos, helped to edit and
              proofread the paper, and participated and collaborated in
              meetings. I also created a supplementary video and designed a website,
              overviewing our project to submit to CHI '24 and IROS '24.
